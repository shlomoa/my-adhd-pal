## 2026-10-11 - A1a Android test-case catalogue

- Issue and PR: see the A1a issue and its PR (closed by the PR).
- Changed: added `docs/test-plans/android.md` with TC-A-001 to TC-A-072 (link-state, DI, tasks/reminders, schedule
  builder, settings, prompts, history, empty/error/accessibility, release, final).
- Validation: docs only. `scripts/require-gate.sh G-BOOT` exited 0. Markdown lint runs in CI once G0 lands.
- Open items: manual cases (TC-A-009, 030, 038, 044, 052, 060, 061, 071, 072) wait for the user. Next: A1b waits for G0/G-ENV/G3a.
